            <h2> RADIATOR</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> The radiator is a heat exchanger used to remove heat from the coolant in the cooling system to prevent
              your
              vehicle’s engine from overheating. Hot coolant is routed through the radiator, where the coolant can
              exchange heat
              with the passing air.
              For general maintenance on your radiator, check your coolant levels twice a year. Replacing a radiator can
              take most
              of the day, but is a doable DIY job. <mark>If you need to replace your radiator</mark>, use AutoZone’s how
              to guide to get the
              job done right. Additionally, you should reference your vehicle’s repair manual, as each vehicle is

              The three types of battery terminals are post or top, side, and L.
              Battery Capacity: The energy output of a battery measured in amp/hours.
              Cold Cranking Amps: Abbreviated CCA, this refers to the amount of current that the battery can supply to
              the
              vehicle. Group Size: The group size is just what it sounds like, the size of the battery. Common group
              sizes
              are: 24, 24F,

              that the component industries operating in the above product segment have a ‘pot of gold’ waiting for them
              to grab. But the question is whether the players in this industry are ready to grab this aftermarket

  <p>While currently India is the sixth-largest automobile producer worldwide, after China, US, Japan, Germany and South
    Korea, thanks to robust demand and government policy support towards the ‘Make in India’ movement, it is expected to
    become the third-largest by 2026. The automotive components industry accounts for 2.3% of India’s GDP and 25% to its
    manufacturing GDP, providing employment to 5 million people, as per the Indian Brand Equity Foundation. So far the
    automotive components industry has registered a CAGR of 6%, reaching USD 49.3 billion in FY20 with exports growing
    at a CAGR of 7.6% to reach USD 14.5 billion in FY20.

    Catapulted by a manufacturing-friendly environment, the industry aims to achieve USD 200 billion in revenue by 2026
    with exports reaching USD 80 billion. The automotive component supplies to OEMs contribute to 56% of the overall
    turnover with aftermarkets and exports sales contributing to 25% and 20%, respectively. The aftermarket turnover
    increased at a CAGR of 9.57% from USD 6.8 billion in FY16 to USD 9.8 billion in FY20 and is expected to reach USD 32
    billion by 2026, as per data published by the Automotive Component Manufacturing Association.</p>

  <h2> <b><i>Unique Industry Characteristics</i></b></h2>
  
  <p class="para6">while deep diving, one should be aware of the unique characteristics or insights with reference to this sector.

    1) Long supply chain that includes Tier II vendor – Tier I vendor – OEM – distributor, dealer and wholesaler –
    retailer – mechanic – consumer.

    • Except the consumer, everyone is chasing their respective monthly targets.
    • Movement of stocks from one entity to the next entity is registered as ‘sales’ while the irony is that actual sale
    happens only when the consumer purchases from the outlet.
    • Unlike FMCG, it is difficult to influence sale of automotive components as the significant portion of sale is
    driven by failure of parts that need replacement.
    • Failure of parts can cause bigger damage, impacting vehicle utilisation.
    • Hence, availability of parts at the retail outlets is not only very critical as consumers show close to zero
    tolerance time but also impacts future sales potential of OE with after-sales and service being important factors.
    • It is not possible to predict all the possible failures and hence it is difficult to predict demand for automotive
    components in terms of what, where and when.
    • The only way possible for the companies to react to such an unpredictable demand is through ‘forecasting’.
    • There is a strong belief that forecasting enables them to ‘push the stocks’ closer to the point of sale.
    • The co-existence of availability and unavailability across the network is not a strange phenomenon at all.

    2) Same parts are available at one location while they can be unavailable at other locations.

    3) In the same location, parts may be available at some point of time while unavailable at some other point of time.

    • Factors such as stock ageing, territory intrusion or invasion, limited availability of working capital, space,
    etc., induce inconsistency in pricing behaviour at outlets.
    • This market is the best example of a red ocean where the competition is fierce in terms of pricing and the
    consumer is confused about product quality.

    It might be shocking to OEMs that the universe of competition is beyond their cognizance:

    a) From OEM parts with ‘OEM’ branding and pricing.
    b) From vendors who supply to OEM also competing with OEM in the aftermarkets.
    c) Though the products are same inside the box, branding or packaging is different.
    d) From the manufacturers who make similar products but do not supply to OEMs, i.e., known brands with comparable
    quality.</p>

  </marquee>

  <h2><b>Key Challenges</b></h2>

  <p>When forecasting is considered as the only possible way to deal the unpredictable demand and supply of the
    aftermarket, the forecasting signal mechanism upstream gets translated as monthly schedules for production to Tier I
    and Tier II vendors. However, actual production significantly varies from planned schedules thanks to various
    batching considerations or availability of resources such as men, machines and materials as well as change of
    schedules since the actual off-take could be different from the forecasted plan and change of priorities, i.e., OE
    versus spares versus VOR, etc.

    This distortion leads to greater production of some items than the actual demand while some items are produced in
    lesser quantities than the actual demand. And this distortion grows wider and bigger as it goes towards the
    downstream thanks to multiplier effect due to the coexistence of two facts, namely, variation and dependent
    entities. Items produced more than the actual demand creates challenges including requirement of more space, more
    capital, capacity stealing, i.e., capacity used up in producing items which are not needed in the immediate horizon,
    material stealing, i.e., components used up in producing items which are not needed in the immediate horizon</p>
